# **Git & Github**

## **Listing local & remote branches**
```bash
# list all local branches
git branch

# list all remote branches
git branch -r

# list all branches including local & remote
git branch -a
```
This command lists all branches stored on the remote, prefixed by the remote name (e.g: `origin/feature-branch`).

## **Creating a new branch**

1. To create a new local branch, use the following command:
```bash
# syntax
git checkout -b <branch-name>
# example
git checkout -b feature1
```

2. To create the copy of the branch in the remote repository:
```bash
# syntax
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
# example
git push origin feature1 
```

3. Or to set an upstream branch, so that a subsequent git pull will know what to do, you might instead want to use:
```bash
# syntax
git push --set-upstream <remote-name> <local-branch-name> 
# example
git push --set-upstream origin feature1
```
The above command creates a remote tracking branch

## **Pull changes from a remote branch**

1. Checkout to the feature branch into which you want to pull and merge the latest changes.

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>

# alternatively
git switch <branch-name>
```
If the branch doesnâ€™t exist locally, you can 
fetch and check it out in one command. The below command creates a new local branch tracking the remote branch:
```bash
git checkout -b --t feature-branch origin/feature-branch
```
The option `-t` or `--track` specifies to track the remote branch and is optional

2. Fetch all the data from the remote repository. After fetch you will have references to all the branches in remote.
```bash
# fetch the latest changes for the currently checked out branch
git fetch
# fetch data from all the repositories
git fetch --all

# or fetch info from a particular repo
git fetch <remote-name> <branch-name> # syntax
git fetch origin main # example
```
## **Best Practices for Pulling Remote Branches**
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your work up-to-date and reduce conflicts.
- Use git fetch to review changes before integrating them.
- Set up tracking branches using <br>
 `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch>` so that git pull automatically fetches and merges the right branch. After setting the remote tracking branch, just check the tracking status using `git branch -vv`

## **Ammending Last Commit Messages**
To change the most recent commit message that is still on your local Git repository, you can run the Git command below:

```sh
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```
This changes the latest commit message. The -m option lets you write a new commit message without Git opening your default text editor. To see the change, you can run the Git command below:
```sh
git log
```
You can type `:q` to exit.

Furthermore, if the commit you amended is already in a remote repository, then you will need to forcefully push it to the remote. Assuming you are currently on the development branch or a feature branch and __not__ in `main` branch, run the Git command below to do this:
```sh
git push origin feature1 --force
```
From above, the remote repository (i.e. origin) will be updated to reflect the updated commit message.

## **Adding and editing remote origins**

To add a remote origin to your git repo use the follwing command
```sh
git remote add origin <remote-url>
```

To reset the remote url
```sh
git remote set-url origin <new-remote-url>
```
